//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['Rush Hour','Rush Hour 2','Rush Hour 3']
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
firstMovie = movies[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
movieLenth = movies.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
lastMovie=movies[movies.length-1]
